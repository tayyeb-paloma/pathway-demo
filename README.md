# Autism Assessment Pathway Task Management System

A full-stack application for managing autism assessment pathway tasks with dependency tracking and real-time synchronization.

## Backend (FastAPI)

### Features
- 40 autism assessment tasks with hierarchical dependencies
- Mock Awell service integration with 200ms delay
- Task status tracking (completed, ready, waiting)
- Recursive task checking for dependency resolution
- CORS-enabled API endpoints

### API Endpoints
- `GET /tasks` - Get all tasks
- `GET /task-status` - Get current task statuses
- `POST /sync-awell` - Sync with Awell service and check ready tasks

### Running the Backend
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## Frontend (React + Vite)

### Features
- Visual task dependency tree using ReactFlow
- Real-time task status visualization
- Color-coded task states (green=completed, yellow=ready, red=waiting)
- Control panel with sync functionality
- Task summary statistics
- Ready tasks list

### Running the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Task Flow
1. Tasks start with "onboarding" (no dependencies)
2. Completed tasks unlock dependent tasks that become "ready"
3. Sync button recursively checks all ready tasks via mock Awell service
4. Visual tree updates to show new task states
5. Process continues until all possible tasks are completed

## Task States
- **Completed** (‚úÖ): Task is done
- **Ready** (üü°): Task is available (all dependencies met)
- **Waiting** (‚è≥): Task has unmet dependencies
